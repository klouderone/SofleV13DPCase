# Sofle V1 Small 3D Printed Case

A small footprint 3D printable case for the Sofle V1, created because didn't like the large size of other 3D printed cases, as I think it takes away from the transportable aspect of these keyboards, and I wasn't pleased with the asthetic of the available minimal cases. A top plate can also be found.

Printed with ESun PLA+ on a Bambu Lab X1C with a .4mm nozzle. I found the 1.6mm PCB friction fit well with a .2mm Top and Bottom Z distance.

## Settings:

Layer Height = .08mm

Wall Loops = 3

Infill = 15% Grid

Support = Yes

Support Type = Normal

Top Z distance = .2mm

Bottom Z distance = .2mm
